This is a fork of the fantastic Polybar script [tam-carre/polywins](https://github.com/tam-carre/polywins). May be heavily modified to my own preferences.

Changes to polywins:

* As a default, only uses left-click for iconify/raise and right-click for window close

Planned:

* Fix [this bug](https://github.com/tam-carre/polywins/issues/11) with spaces and dots in window names
* Ways to sort the window list
* Format hidden windows differently (take a look at this [PR](https://github.com/tam-carre/polywins/pull/9))
* Configurable nicknames for chosen window classes (e.g. TelegramDesktop -> Telegram)
* Ability to configure click-actions
